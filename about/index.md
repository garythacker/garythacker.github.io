# About


**Hello there**,

**Welcome to My Blog.**

I graduated :mortar_board: from [Western Kentucky University](https://www.wku.edu/) back in 2005 and currently working as
a Software Engineer :computer: based in Kentucky. 

I enjoy reading quite a bit. One day I decided - why not start my own little blog to share some of my writings for others? 

I don't consider myself the most prolific writer out there, but I plan to contribute small pieces here and there when inspiration strikes.

Even if posts aren't too frequent, I welcome anyone interested to subscribe or check back periodically for new content whenever I get around to penning something.

Thanks for stopping by!

Gary
